    The best way to become familiar with the explorer is to <span style={{fontStyle:'italic'}}>play with it</span> (experiment).
    Once in a while, review the lists below. Click on any title below for details.

        Dataset Options
    </CardTitle>
    <CardText expandable style={{paddingTop:"0px"}}>
    <p>There are several dataset options available for charts:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Viewpoint:</strong> broad approaches to budget (or actual) data, based on similar 
        classification schemes (taxonomies), and data sources.</li>
    <li><strong>Version:</strong> alternate detailed datasets available for the selected viewpoint</li>
    <li><strong>Aspect:</strong> particular aspects of the budget, such as Revenue, Expenses or Staffing</li>
    <li><strong>By Unit:</strong> the beginnings of diagnostic analytics, using simple math to view the 
        data compared with relevant related metrics, such as per person or per household</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Choices for the selections are interdependent. Toronto budgets have similar classifications for 
        Revenue and Expenses for example, and therefore these can be viewed together (as offered by the 
        <em>both</em> and <em>net</em> Aspects). Financial statements 
        on the other hand do not have similar classifications for Revenue and Expenses.</p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong><em>Viewpoint</em></strong> choices include:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Budget (by function)</strong></dt>
        <dd>combines City of Toronto Agencies and Divisions into groups according to the nature of 
            the services delivered (this is the default). The classification scheme above the 
            Division/Agency level was developed by Budgetpedia project contributors.
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Budget (by structure)</strong></dt>
        <dd>more traditional: separates Agencies from Divisions, and generally by organizational
            structures. Groupings are closer to those found in City annual Budget Summaries.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Financial Statements</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            This reporting structure is manadated by the province (and GAAP -- Generally Accepted
            Accounting Principles), is functional, and is comparable to other municipalities in the 
            province. Summary groupings above the statment level are added by the Budgetpedia project
            for easier access.
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Expenses by Object</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            Expenses by Object is a restatement of expenses by object of expenditure, such as materials,
            or Wages & Salaries. These categories cross all Divisions and Agencies, and therefore provide a 
            general picture of the ways that money is spent.

    <p>
        <strong><em>Version</em></strong> choices depend on the Viewpoint that is chosen.
    </p>
    <p><em>Budget viewpoint  Versions</em> (for both functional and structural viewpoints) include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Summary</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Detail (FPARS)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Variance Reports</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Financial statement viewpoint Versions</em> include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Audited Financial Statements</li>
    <li>Financial Information Returns (FIRs for MMAH)</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <p>
        <strong><em>Aspect</em></strong> choices depend on the Viewpoint that is chosen.
    </p>
    <p><em>Budget viewpoint  Aspects</em> (for both functional and structural viewpoints) include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Revenue</li>
    <li>Expenses</li>
    <li>Both</li>
    <li>Net</li>
    <li>Staffing</li>
    </ul>
    <p> All of these are based on City documents which have similar line items across all aspects. This 
        makes the figures from all sources comparable.
    </p>

    <p><em>Financial statement viewpoint Aspects</em> include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Revenue</li>
    <li>Expenses</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The classification schemes for these are different for each, and therefore they cannot be 
        combined.
    </p>
    <p><em>Expenses by Object viewpoint Aspects</em> include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Expenses</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These come from notes to the audited financial statements.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
        <strong><em>By Unit</em></strong> choices are common for all other choices, and include:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Per staffing position</li>
    <li>Population: per person</li>
    <li>Population: per 100,000 people</li>
    <li>Per household</li>
    </ul>
